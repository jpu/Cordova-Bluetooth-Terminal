# SToRM32 Droid Control

[![dependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/jpu/storm32-droid-control/status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/jpu/storm32-droid-control)

*Work in progress*

Android app for controlling a SToRM32 gimbal controller via Bluetooth. Built with Apache Cordova (PhoneGap).

Based on
[https://github.com/1oginov/Cordova-Bluetooth-Terminal](https://github.com/1oginov/Cordova-Bluetooth-Terminal)

## Quick Start

### PhoneGap Build

You can build and install an APK usingÂ [https://build.phonegap.com](https://build.phonegap.com)
without installing anything.

### Local build

Make sure you have [cordova-cli](https://cordova.apache.org/) installed globally, install with the help of
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) otherwise:

```sh
$ npm install -g cordova
```

Clone repository, jump into, pull platforms (only **android** by default) and plugins: 

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jpu/storm32-droid-control.git
$ cd storm32-droid-control
$ cordova prepare
```

Also, you can check Cordova requirements (optional or is something failed):

```sh
$ cordova requirements
```

Build:

```sh
$ cordova build
```

Or run on connected Android device via USB:

```sh
$ cordova run
```

Emulator is useless here, because you need working bluetooth module.

## Usage

#### Requirements
* Smartphone (tablet, etc)
* A SToRM32 controller board (tested using 1.32 board, on 0.96 software version)
* Bluetooth module (tested with HC-06)

#### Disclaimer

Warning! This code is still work in progress, so try this first with your gimbal motors disabled (power using USB, not battery, or disconnect pitch & roll motors, for example).

### First time use

* Install the Bluetooth module on the SToRM32 board. 
* Configure the Bluetooth module (see SToRM32 docs), give a name containing "storm" to the bluetooth adapter, either using the AT command or the o323bgc tool.
* Pair your phone with the module. Default passcode is 1234.
* Install the APK on your phone. 
* Run the app. 

Things should be simple enough from there.

# Future

This is currently just a proof of concept, and pretty limited in features. But it can be extended. 

Some ideas: 
* Actuate the gimbal according to phone orientation
* Actuate the gimbal by object or smart tag tracking
* Integrate IFTTT or other Android events
