Show gopro live stream on the page with the gimbal controls

- GoPro streams out a UDP stream
- The browser isn't able to show a UDP stream video directly
- Either
    a) use a cordova extension which 
        - uses ffmpeg to read the udp stream
        - copies the stream to a websocket server
        , and then
        - connect to the websocket from the client js app
        - use the jsmpeg lib to decode and show the stream
    or
    b) use a cordova extension which
        - shows the udp video stream on an overlay on top 
          of the client js app
        , and modify the client js app to reserve 
          some empty space for it
    or
    c) use a cordova extension which
        - receives incoming udp stream
       , and feed the udp stream to jsmpeg
